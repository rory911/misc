<font size='5'><center> Process SQL records with Node.js/express/joi services </center><br>
<font size='4'>This simple Node.js/express/joi program uses the following JSON
   records to feed the SQL database:<br>
<pre>
   <b>ID:</b> <i>string</i>
   <b>Title:</b> <i>string</i>
   <b>Desc:</b> <i>string</i>
</pre>
Navigate to <a href='mysql-records'>MySQL-records</a> and use the 
RESTful interface for building and modifying the SQL database.
&nbsp; Postman and phpMyAdmin are recommended for driving the
interface with POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.&nbsp;
Experience with URL query strings is required with Postman. &nbsp;
Refresh MySQL-records after each Postman method finishs. &nbsp
Use the GET method with Postman, or send SQL commands from
pdpMyAdmin to display the SQL database.
